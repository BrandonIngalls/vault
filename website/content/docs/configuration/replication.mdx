# `replication` Stanza

The `replication` stanza specifies various parameters for tuning replication related values.

```hcl
replication {
  resolver_discover_servers = true
  logshipper_buffer_length = 1000
  logshipper_buffer_size = "5gb"
}
```

## `replication` Parameters

- `resolver_discover_servers` `(boolean: true)` - Indicates if the resolver should discover servers.
- `logshipper_buffer_length` `(integer: 0)` - The maximum number of entries that the log shipper buffer can hold.
- `logshipper_buffer_size` `(string: "")` - The maximum size that the log shipper buffer can be. This size can be
  expressed as an integer, indicating the number of bytes, or as a capacity string. Capacity strings are a number,
  followed by an optional space, followed by a suffix indicating the capacity. Valid suffixes are:
  `kb, kib, mb, mib, gb, gib, tb, tib`, which correspond to kilobytes, kibibytes, megabytes, mebibytes, etc. Full
  details on multiple-byte units in both powers of 2 and 10 can be found
  [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units). The suffixes are not case-sensitive.
